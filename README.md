#Proposal

The asset is intended to aid stock borrowing and lending managers by providing various data insights into current positions of trades. This also showcases how IBM Cloud Pak for Data(CP4D) can act as an enablement of generating SBL files (stock borrowing & lending files). This file enables the SBL manager to get various data insights on current trends and positions.It gathers data from various sources, transforms and generates visualization, while doing so, it also creates a data model, tracks lineage and creates a metadata catalog, keeps an eye on data pipelines (data observability)

This asset focuses to address key problems in financial markets such as data silos, data quality, lack of lineage and data catalogs, no data observability, etc.,

The asset serves as a reference to address the market-leading capabilities of CP4D to realize and maintain the data architectures for large and medium financial institutions with complex data processing requirements to serve their business functions. This asset will cover the entire lifecycle of the data ingestion, processing, cataloging, and analytics to enable business users to fully explore the business data to drive insights and decision-making, with minimal IT involvement. This asset will also demonstrate how to ensure real-time and proactive monitoring of the data estate for reliable data delivery to run your business.

The use-case is representative of many other such business processes in BFSI and can be used to effectively communicate that the CP4D can realize a modern data architecture for better business outcomes.

Purpose

Objective of this asset is to enable banks and brokerage firms to make their stock borrowing and lending process easy and efficient by leveraging IBM Technologies.

This asset aligns with BFSIâ€™s IBM play for Data Fabric. It also involves the key capabilities in CP4Dv4.6 around data lineage with MANTA. IBM has also recently acquired Databand, around Data Observability.Currently, the story around data catalog, lineage, and observability is fragmented and told in silos. This asset weaves together these elements into a single storyboard with a complex BFSI use case to make it contextual to an industry-focused conversation.
